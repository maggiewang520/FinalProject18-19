# FinalProject18-19

## Description

In my final project game, the player - you - will embark on an adventure. 
You will be thrusted into the hectic depths of LA with nothing except a desire to escape.
The first part of the choose-your-own-adventure story involves visiting different locations around LA.
At these locations, you will encounter Youtubers and celebrities - pairs of them, more specifically - who are associated with one another.
You will be given a choice of making allies and enemies, forming two teams. 
After the teams are formed, you will be travelling to WALMART!
There, you will be given a choice between different special attacks and defenses that you can use.
After all of this... finally... you will enter a battle to the death!
The 5 pairs of influencers will fight one another - and best 3 out of 5 battles wins!
